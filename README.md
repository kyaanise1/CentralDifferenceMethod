# Central Difference Method Calculator

**Central Difference Method**, a finite difference technique commonly used in numerical differentiation.

## üìå Method Explanation

The **Central Difference Method** is a second-order accurate formula used to approximate the derivative of a function:

\[
f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}
\]

Where:
- \( f(x) \) is the function
- \( x \) is the point at which the derivative is estimated
- \( h \) is a small step size

This method is preferred over forward or backward differences due to its improved accuracy and symmetry around the point \( x \).
